# PRODIGY_CS_02 – Image Encryption 🖼️

A simple Python tool to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel-level manipulation. Techniques include:
- Inverting pixel values
- Flipping and rotating images

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Image processing with PIL (Pillow)
- Basics of image encryption
- Visualizing encryption effects

## 🚀 How to Run In Terminal

🔧 Step-by-step:

    Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv

    Activate it:

source venv/bin/activate

You'll now see your prompt change (something like: (venv) kali@kali)

    Install OpenCV inside the virtual environment:

pip install opencv-python

    Now run your script:

python image_encryptor.py
